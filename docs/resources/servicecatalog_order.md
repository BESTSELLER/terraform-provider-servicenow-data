  Please note that Service Now catalog orders are immutable.
  That means if you try to destroy an order, it will be removed from terraform but nothing will happen in Service Now.
  Also, if you try to update an order, it will be removed from terraform and a new one will be created. In other words, you will end up with two orders in service now.

# servicenow-data_servicecatalog_order (Resource)

A Service Now ServiceCatalog order. It consumes the "order_now" API ( https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/utah/rest/c_ServiceCatalogAPI#servicecat-POST-items-order_now )

Please note that Service Now catalog orders are immutable.
That means if you try to destroy an order, it will be removed from terraform but nothing will happen in Service Now.
Also, if you try to update an order, it will be removed from terraform and a new one will be created. In other words, you will end up with two orders in service now.

## Example Usage

```terraform

  sc_cat_item_id = "e2a2e5bc1b757850d5a68773604bcb32"
  variables = {
    "var1" : "value1",
    "var2" : "value2",
    "var3" : "value3",
